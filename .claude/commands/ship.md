Commit all staged and unstaged changes with a descriptive commit message, then push to the remote repository. Follow these steps:

1. Run `git status` to see what files have changed
2. Run `git diff` to understand the changes
3. Run `git log --oneline -3` to see recent commit message style
4. Stage all changes with `git add .`
5. Create a commit with a clear, descriptive message following the repository's commit style
6. Push to the current branch with `git push`

Make sure the commit message accurately describes what was changed and why.
