Existing approaches either rely on modular system designs with extensive agent orchestration or employ over-simplified instruction schemas, providing limited guidance and poor generalizability. This paper introduces an orchestration-free framework using Task-Oriented Flowcharts (TOFs) to enable end-to-end automation without manual intervention. We first define the co",
